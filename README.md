# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
I interpret user needs by doing my best to look at the program from their perspective. I feel that you should simply try your best to see what a user would look for in whatever you are building, and, in this case, it was the SNHU travel project. After you figure out what the user wants OI feel at this point itâ€™s pretty straightforward, write good code. Creating user stories helps with this by helping the software team plan how much time implementing each functionality will take. This helps the team stay organized and on schedule with any release dates. I approach developing programs with an open attitude always looking to learn something new. One agile process that I hope to incorporate into my future work is Kanban boards. I feel that these help a software team greatly and is a great tool for all developers. I believe that being a good team member in software development aside from learning the code base is coming with a good attitude. For me the most important thing is loving what you do so if this is the case then you will come to work ready to tackle whatever bug lies ahead.
